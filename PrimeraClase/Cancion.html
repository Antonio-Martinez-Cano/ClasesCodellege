    <h1>The Mystic (Adam Jensen)</h1>
      <p>Got a head full of spiders</p>
      <p>And a heart that isn't here</p>
      <p>In a room full of liars</p>
      <p>All my demons reappear</p>

              </br>

      <p>Broken cigarettes and bullet holes</p>
      <p>One more to the chest and I'm alone</p>
      <p>Nothing gets me any higher</p>
      <p>And nothing ever will</p>

              </br>

      <p>Tried to stay sober</p>
      <p>Tried to stay clean</p>
      <p>Wake me when it's over</p>
      <p>Like a bad dream</p>

              </br>

      <p>Mama doesn't call</p>
      <p>Sister never writes</p>
      <p>Bet you they would laugh</p>
      <p>If I called to say goodbye</p>

              </br>

      <p>No ones gonna worry</p>
      <p>Notice when I'm gone</p>
      <p>No they won't know I'm missin'</p>
      <p>‘Till they pull me out the mystic</p>

              </br>

      <p>I bet nobody can remember</p>
      <p>What color eyes are on my face</p>
      <p>I'm a freak, I'm a pretender</p>
      <p>I never really had a place</p>

              </br>

      <p>Broken cigarettes and bullet holes</p>
      <p>One more to the chest ‘till I'm alone</p>
      <p>Nothin' gets me any higher</p>
      <p>And nothin' ever will</p>

              </br>

      <p>Tried to stay sober</p>
      <p>Tried to stay clean</p>
      <p>Wake me…</p>
